# Java ArithmeticException: Integer Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes overlooked error in Java: the `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero.  The `UncommonBug.java` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in an exception at runtime. The solution shows appropriate handling.

The solution demonstrates how to gracefully handle the potential `ArithmeticException` using a `try-catch` block.  This prevents abrupt program termination and allows for more robust error handling.  This is a crucial aspect of writing resilient Java applications.
